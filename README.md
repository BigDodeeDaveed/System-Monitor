# System-Monitor
A real time System Monitor that shows current CPU and RAM usage, as well as how much free space is available in your hard drive. This project uses psutil library to get real time CPU and RAM and Disk Storage information. I used Custom Tkinter instead of the normal one since it gives a better and cleaner GUI in my opinion.
